        <p class="info">We provide flat rate process service to most areas of the Greater Phoenix Area by knowledgeable Officers of the Court. We will make at least four attempts of service. Your documents will be handled with the same level of care that you would handle them. Your service will be attempted within two days after we receive it. You will be provided instructions on how to create a login so that you may view the status of your documents at any time and view your Certificate of Service via our website once it’s been filed with the courts.  The certificate of service will be filed promptly after the other party is served.</p>

        <p class="title">Long Distance Service</p>
        <p class="info">Occasionally a great distance must be traveled in order to attempt service. When this occurs additional fees may be necessary.</p>


        <p class="price">Price: $30 per hour<br /></p>
        <p class="title">Stake Out</p>
        <p class="info">From time to time the other party in your case may try to avoid service in an attempt to delay or dismiss the case. When this occurs it may benefit you to have us stake out the other party. In these cases we try to narrow down appropriate time frames to avoid unnecessary costs to the client.</p>

        <p class="price">Price: $25<br /></p>        
        <p class="title">Skip Trace</p>
        <p class="info">If you’re not sure where the other party resides we may be able to locate them through various methods that we have learned through our experiences or utilize several other tools we have at our disposal.</p>
