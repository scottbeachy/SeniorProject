        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>My name is Bill Compton. I am the President of We Serve U LLC a family owned and operated business that is emerging into the legal services market. I am a United States Marine Corps Veteran from the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, and have served in the Iraqi campaign as an infantryman. Both my service and my Midwestern upbringing have taught me that hard work, dedication, and respect are the keys to being successful. My goal for We Serve U LLC is to be successful so that I can share that success with my clients and servers.</p>
        <p>As the President of We Serve U LLC it is my responsibility to steer the organization in the right direction for its stakeholders. It is my expectation that we have two core competencies that our business will revolve around. Our focus is on providing excellent customer service and professional process service. We are using advances in modern technology to provide accountability that is accessible to all staff and clients via the internet. We are also using automation to help reduce the potential for errors, and help expedite processing. By doing this we can focus more on the customer, and proper service.</p>
        <p>By using this technology we are expecting to reduce our overhead costs which we plan on sharing with the client and the server. By offering the server a better rate we are requiring that they give more specialized attention to each serve, and ensure that it is done properly, professionally, and respectfully. By doing this they can help reduce the chance that the service will be contested. The reduction in overhead also allows us to remain competitive with other process serving agencies in Arizona while providing the best services we can to our client.</p>
